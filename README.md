# Headamp - Headphones amplifier 

This amplifier has one stereo input (from line-level sources - phones, mp3 players...) and one mono input (high impedance "instrument" level - guitars, basses etc). The level of each input can be adjusted.

Power source: one 9V battery or a 9v guitar pedal power supply.

__Attention: this project is a work in progress, unfinished at this time__

## Introduction

The high impedance instrument input is based on my another project, "Activator". __TODO: add github link.__

Just for fun, I'm using here old outdated (you may call it "vintage") and fairly low spec germanium transistors but these work fairly well. I have a ton of germanium transistors from ex-URSS so why not use them! The circuit will work with modern transistors with litlle to no modifications. 

## Theory
