All the simulations are done in LTSpice IV, freeware SPICE simulation software from Analog Devices.

This version is out of support now, a newer version exists at https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html# all the schematics files in this repository should be reasonably compatible with the latest version (version XVII at this time, May 2021).

LTSpice XVII will NOT run on older computers (for example on Windows XP)
